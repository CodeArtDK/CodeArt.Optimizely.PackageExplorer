# 🧰 CodeArt.Optimizely.PackageExplorer

**CodeArt.Optimizely.PackageExplorer** is an open-source Blazor WebAssembly tool designed to open, inspect, and eventually edit [Optimizely (Episerver)](https://www.optimizely.com/) content packages (`.episerverdata`, `.episerverpackage` files) — right in your browser.

> Think of it as a local, user-friendly visual explorer for Episerver content packages.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Upload and open `.episerverdata` / `.episerverpackage` files  
- ✅ Inspect their contents in a structured UI  
- ✅ View content, media, content types, categories, visitor groups, and more  
- ✅ Drill down into content details and metadata using tree views and dialogs  

All powered by [Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/).

## 🛤 Roadmap

The current version is focused on **read-only exploration** of package contents. But this is just the beginning:

### ✅ MVP (now)
- Open and parse Episerver content packages
- Display structured UI with tabs and tree views
- Provide insights into content hierarchy and metadata

### 🛠 Coming Soon
- ✏️ Edit packages directly in the UI
- 🔁 Convert packages to other formats (e.g., JSON, XML, cross-CMS import formats)
- 📦 Create new packages from scratch
- 🔍 Compare packages (diff support)
- 🤖 CLI support for automation and scripting
- 💾 Save/export modified packages

## 📷 Screenshots

> Coming soon — UI screenshots and demo GIFs will be added as the app evolves.
